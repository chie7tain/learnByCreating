        <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly
        magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything
        from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to
        just reboot the darn thing. We belive there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning
        technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href='https://learnenough.com/email' target="_blank">sign up for our official email list now.</a>

            HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Bernes-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Founders</h2>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Micheal Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We belive that the kind of technical sophistication taugt by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
        <p>

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table. Totaly follow Nick on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmerwin" target="_blank">here</a>

            William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).<strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most
            famous, and begins like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>Rough winds do
                shake the darling buds of May,<br> And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
            </p>
